# A AStyle build tree may provide either one or multiple build
# configurations depending on the CMake generator used.
# Since AStyle can be used either from a build tree or an install
# tree it is useful for outside projects to know the configurations available.
# If this AStyleConfig.cmake is in a AStyle install
# tree AStyle_CONFIGURATION_TYPES will be empty and
# AStyle_BUILD_TYPE will be set to the value of
# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE used to build AStyle. If AStyleConfig.cmake
# is in a AStyle build tree then AStyle_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
# and AStyle_BUILD_TYPE will have values matching CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
# and CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE for that build tree (only one will ever be set).
